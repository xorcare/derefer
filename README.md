Package derefer contains helper routines for simplifying the getting of
optional fields of basic type. This allows you to get the value from the
pointer even if it is nil, because in this case the zero value of the
specified type will be received.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/xorcare/derefer
```

## Examples

Examples of using the library are presented on [godoc.org][EXD]
and in the [source library code][EXS].
