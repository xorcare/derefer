Package derefed contains helper routines for simplifying the getting of optional
fields of basic type. This allows you to get the value from the pointer even,
but if the pointer is nil it returns a value of second parameter.

## Examples

Examples of using the library are presented on [godoc.org][EXD]
and in the [source library code][EXS].
